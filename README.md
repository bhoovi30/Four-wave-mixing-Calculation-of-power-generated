When a high-power optical signal is launched into a fiber, the linearity of the optical response is lost. One such nonlinear effect, which is due to the electric susceptibility is called the optical Kerr effect.
1), 2) Four-wave mixing (FWM) is a type of optical Kerr effect, and occurs when light of two or more different wavelengths is launched into a fiber. FWM occurs when light of three different wavelengths is launched into a fiber, giving rise to a new wave (known as an idler), the wavelength of which does not coincide with any of the others. FWM is a kind of optical parametric oscillation. In the transmission of dense wavelength-division multiplexed (DWDM) signals, FWM is to be avoided, but for certain applications, it provides an effective technological basis for fiber-optic devices. FWM also provides the basic technology for measuring the nonlinearity and chromatic dispersion of optical fibers. This paper discusses those aspects of R & D into FWM applications that the authors have carried out recently in connection with broadband all-optical simultaneous wavelength conversion and a technique for measuring the nonlinear coefficient of optical fibers.
