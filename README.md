Four-wave mixing (F WM) is a phenomenon that be avoided in DWDM transmission, but depending 
on the application it is the basis of important second-generation optical devices and optical device 
measurement technology. This paper discusses the theory of FWM, and then introduces one of its 
applications --a broadband all-optical simultaneous wavelength converter developed using a high 
nonlinearity dispersion fiber (HNL-DSF) that efficiently produces FWM. The conversion bandwidth 
extends to 23.3 nm HWHM (halfwidth at half maximum), the widest yet reported for wavelength 
conversion using non-polarization maintaining liber, as a further application, a novel technique is 
introduced for measuring the nonlinear coefficient of optical fibers by evaluating FWM generating 
efficiency. With this technique it is now possible to effect simultaneous measurement of the chromatic 
dispersion and nonlinear coefficient of fiber
